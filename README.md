# London Travel

A simple Object Orientated app, simulating simulating the TFL Oystercard in London - functions via the console on a web browser. Test driven in JavaScript ES6 with the Jasmine library, this showcases good coding prncipals: Encapsulation, DRY, SRP, TDD and dependancy injection, built on the a set of user stories. The 'spyOn' feature of Jasmine was also used to seperate the concerns of the spec files, spyOnObj was used for test doubles, to unit test in isolation, and a grouped feature test was conducted with the real objects to thoroughly test the entire program.

## How to Run

Clone this repo, and from the command line navigate to the [_London Travel_](london_travel).

Right click on the `SpecRunner.html` file and select `Copy Path`. Paste this into the Google Chrome Web Browser.

Right click, and open the chrome Developer Tools by selecting `Inspect`. Clcik the `Console` tab at the top. You can then type in the following:

```
let travelCard = new TravelCard()
station = new Station("Woodford", 1);
stationTwo = new Station("Hampstead", 3);
stationThree = new Station("Warren Street", 5);
```

This will instantiate the objects needed for the program. You can then type in the following to action the objects accordingly:

```
travelCard.topUp(20)
travelCard.touchIn(station)
travelCard.touchOut(stationThree)
travelCard.balance
travelCard.journey
```

You can then explore the saved journey history, spending, and see if a journey is incomplete or not. Useful messages will be displayed when a user 'touches in' and 'touching out', giving station and charge information. Errors will also be thrown if credit is added above the max cap or when insufficent funds are on the card when starting a journey. Charges are calculated between the zones of the station, with a max charge of Â£7. If a journey is not completed, the max charge will be used.
